This is a textbook on the topic of digital media education. It is aimed at student teachers and teachers, but also at media educators and other people who deal with questions of digitalization in pedagogical and non-pedagogical fields of action and are interested in the ways in which digital technologies transform our social, societal and cultural practices. As a ›Thinking and Toolbox‹, this document contains various theoretical and methodological starting points for both independent and joint exploration of digital transformation processes.
